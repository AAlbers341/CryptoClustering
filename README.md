 CryptoClustering

In this exercise, we are predicting if cryptocurrencies are impacted by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. By leveraging Python and unsupervised learning, we can test the dataset on algorithms K-Means and Principal Component Analysis(PCA), to compare how they represent the data, loss of information, and interpretability of the predictions.

## Resources

All the Python script leveraged in this code is being utilized from resources learned in class and sklearn documentation that can be found here:
